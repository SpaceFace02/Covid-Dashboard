## OpsLyft Assignment

### Some of the things I did:

- Dashboard
- Global Cases
- Backend on heroku to ingest API data
- Used Mantine for the UI
- Used oAuth2.0 authentication using Firebase
- Reactive Table Search, RealTime Updates
- Used React.js for the frontend and Node, MongoDB for the backend.

### Some things to keep in mind

- I'm using heroku free dyno hours, so the first load of the website may be a bit slow, but after the first load, its fast
- The graph of time vs cases looks like it doesn't update, but the new number of cases is now low, that it doesn't update as much. Checking previous months data delineates the change more. Like in Jan, cases increase slightly everyday.
- I finished the project in 3 days, so I couldn't handle security and vulnerabilities much, so if you see a red screen saying something is dangerous, its not. The entire code is available on Github, so its nothing to worry about.
